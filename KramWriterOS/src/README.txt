Thank you for buying my MP3 FM Transmitter! 

For legal reasons I am not able to include copyrighted material on this device, but here is a small guide to push you in the right direction:

How this works:
You already have the SD Card inserted, so that's good. You can see the example Folders I created with copyright free material. Each Folder represents a playlist that you can select from on the device. You can set the playlist image by naming a 240x240 PNG file in the corresponding folder "HIER NAME EINFÜGEN". Assigning a cover image to each mp3 is done by giving them the same name. 

If you want to recreate my GTA Radio here's how to do it

1. Download cover images online
As a backdrop to each radio station you also need a 240x240 PNG File. This google drive folder has them for each of the 3D GTA games. Also download the corresponding Radio logo:

2. Download the radio files
Use long mp3 files that contain the whole radio station. Here are the videos I used. Download the files and rename them to be the same as the cover images. Downloading YouTube videos right now has some issues but downloading them through "YT-DLP" or "4K Video Downloader" should always work.

3. Combine the files
Add the files to the SD Card like this:

SONGS/
 └── GTA3/
      ├── FLASH.png
      ├── FLASH.mp3
      ├── KJAH.png
      ├── KJAH.mp3
      ├── ...
      └── RadioLogo.png
 └── GTA4/

      ├── Blonded Radio.png
      ├── Blonded Radio.mp3
      ├── ...
      └── RadioLogo.png

Now reinsert the sd card into the slot. Plugging it into your car now allows you to play your added radio stations. Again, thank you for helping a broke computer science student pay his rent!
